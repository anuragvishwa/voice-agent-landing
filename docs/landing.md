# Never Miss an Emergency Call Again

## 24/7 Inbound Call Capture + Triage + Dispatch for Restoration (Water / Fire / Mold)

**Stop losing high-ticket jobs to missed calls, after-hours gaps, and “we’ll call you back.”**  
Your AI-assisted intake and dispatch system answers every inbound call, captures the right details, routes to on-call teams, and tracks outcomes—across one location or an entire dealer/franchise-style footprint.

> **Built for restoration operators** who win on speed: water mitigation, fire damage, mold remediation, contents + reconstruction.

## The Problem

When emergencies hit, customers call **multiple companies**.  
If your team is on-site, driving, short-staffed, or it’s after-hours:

- Calls go unanswered
- Voicemails aren’t returned fast enough
- Intake details are incomplete
- Dispatch is slow or messy
- Leads leak → competitors win

**One missed “real” call can cost thousands.**

---

## The Solution

### A Dedicated “Emergency Intake & Dispatch” System

Answer every inbound call **24/7**, collect structured details, and **dispatch instantly**—with full visibility.

**Core outcomes**

- **Higher capture rate** (fewer missed calls)
- **Faster dispatch** (less time-to-contact)
- **Cleaner intake** (less back-and-forth)
- **More booked inspections** (more revenue)
- **Operational clarity** (dashboards + recordings + outcomes)

---

## How It Works (End-to-End)

### 1) Call Handling (Inbound)

Customer calls your primary line or a dedicated emergency number. The system:

- Plays required disclosures (e.g., recording notice where applicable)
- Identifies caller intent (water/fire/mold/other)
- Collects key details (address, severity, insurance, access, photos link)
- Offers **warm transfer** to your on-call lead for true emergencies
- Captures voicemail + SMS fallback if caller can’t stay on the line

### 2) Triage & Qualification

The system categorizes the lead:

- **Emergency** (active leak, standing water, smoke damage, health risk)
- **Urgent** (same-day inspection needed)
- **Routine** (estimate request, mold inspection scheduling)

### 3) Dispatch & Booking

- Sends dispatch alerts to your team via **SMS / email / Slack / Teams**
- Creates a **calendar booking** for inspection (or your scheduler queue)
- Routes to correct branch/crew based on location + capacity
- Shares a standardized **dispatch summary** (copy-paste-ready)

### 4) Evidence & Recordkeeping

- Call recording + transcript (optional, configurable)
- Structured intake record
- Tagging (water/fire/mold, commercial/residential, insurance yes/no)
- Outcome tracking (booked / not booked / lost reason)

### 5) Analytics & Optimization

- Missed call rate
- Speed-to-answer
- Booked inspection rate
- Top lost reasons
- After-hours performance
- Team response time SLAs

## Why This Beats “Just Pick Up the Phone”

Even if your call volume is “not huge,” the key failure modes are:

- calls cluster (two at once)
- after-hours gaps
- on-site work (can’t answer)
- inconsistent intake
- lack of visibility/accountability

We turn “chaos calls” into a tracked pipeline with dispatch SLAs.

## FAQ

### “Do we need to replace our current phone system?”

No. We can run alongside your existing number via forwarding/routing, or provision a dedicated emergency line.

You choose the mode:

- keypad-fast (most reliable)
- short AI-assisted intake
- full conversational intake (optional)

### “What if the caller is extremely urgent?”

We can add “Press 0 for immediate transfer” and escalate to your on-call lead instantly.

### “Can we run inbound-only?”

Yes. That’s the recommended first phase for speed and simplicity.

### “Does this integrate with our CRM?”

Yes via webhooks/Zapier and deeper custom integrations for common systems.

### “What about compliance for recording and texts?”

We provide configurable controls: recording disclosures, regional policies, consent flags, retention rules. You decide what to enable.

# How It Works

This system turns **every inbound emergency call** into a **tracked, dispatched, booked** job—without relying on someone “being free to pick up.”

---

## 0) Setup (one-time, fast)

### Phone routing

You choose one of these:

- **Option A (recommended):** We provision a new “Emergency” number and forward/advertise it.
- **Option B:** We **forward your existing number** (after-hours only, or overflow when busy).
- **Option C:** We run in **parallel** (e.g., overflow if unanswered in 2 rings).

### Your rules

- Service areas (zip codes / counties)
- On-call schedule (who gets dispatched when)
- Escalation rules (if no one responds in X minutes → alert backup)
- Intake script (water/fire/mold + fields you care about)
- Recording/transcript policy (on/off, retention window)

---

## 1) Answer & Disclosure (instant)

As soon as the customer calls:

- The system **answers immediately** (no rings forever, no voicemail limbo)
- Plays your **brand greeting**
- Plays any required **call recording disclosure** (configurable)
- Offers a **fast “emergency path”** (e.g., “Press 0 to connect now”)

---

## 2) Capture the Intake (structured, not chaos)

The caller is guided through a short flow (you choose the mode):

### Mode A: Keypad-fast (most reliable)

- “Press 1 water, 2 fire, 3 mold”
- Address / zip (speech or keypad)
- “Is the leak active right now? 1 yes / 2 no”
- Callback number confirmation

### Mode B: Hybrid (short AI-assisted questions)

- AI asks 3–6 questions, then **reads back a summary**
- Caller confirms: “Is this correct? Yes/No”

### Mode C: Full conversational agent (optional)

- Natural conversation for complex cases
- Hard guardrails: keep it short, avoid long talk, always offer human transfer

**Either way, the output is the same:** a structured intake record.

---

## 3) Triage & Qualification (in seconds)

The system classifies the call into a priority bucket:

- **Emergency:** active leak, standing water, smoke damage, health/safety risk
- **Urgent:** same-day inspection likely needed
- **Routine:** estimate request, mold test scheduling, non-urgent follow-up

It also tags things like:

- Residential vs commercial
- Insurance yes/no (or unknown)
- Location / service area match
- Duplicate caller (repeat call)

---

## 4) Dispatch (the money moment)

Once triaged, the system immediately dispatches to the right person:

### Dispatch message includes (always)

- **Type:** Water / Fire / Mold
- **Priority:** Emergency / Urgent / Routine
- **Address + map link**
- **Caller name + callback**
- **Key notes** (active leak, etc.)
- **Recording + transcript link**
- **Photos upload link** (optional)

Example:

> 🚨 WATER EMERGENCY  
> 123 Main St, San Francisco (map)  
> Active leak: YES • Standing water: YES  
> Caller: John • 415-xxx-xxxx  
> Insurance: Unknown  
> Recording: … • Transcript: …  
> Take ownership: Reply “1” to accept

### Acknowledge + escalation

- First responder can **accept** the lead (one tap / reply)
- If nobody accepts within X minutes → **escalate** to backup
- If still no response → **call-through escalation** (auto-dial the on-call list)

---

## 5) Book the Inspection (optional but powerful)

Depending on your workflow:

- **Instant booking:** system offers an inspection slot and confirms via SMS
- **Queue booking:** it routes to your office scheduler queue with priority + context
- **Warm transfer:** for emergencies, it connects caller to on-call lead immediately

---

## 6) Customer Updates (optional, controlled)

If enabled (and based on your consent workflow):

- “We’ve dispatched a technician”
- “Tech is en route, ETA 35 minutes”
- “Please share photos/videos here”
- “Confirm appointment at 2pm tomorrow”

You can run **inbound-only** if you want to keep it ultra-simple.

---

## 7) Team Console (everything is visible)

Every call becomes a card in a pipeline:

**New → Qualified → Booked → Dispatched → Completed → Won/Lost**

Each record includes:

- structured fields (type, severity, insurance, address)
- transcript + recording
- owner / assignee
- timestamps (speed-to-answer, speed-to-dispatch)
- outcome + lost reason

---

## 8) Analytics (what you’ll actually use)

You get dashboards on:

- Answer rate (missed calls eliminated)
- After-hours performance
- Booked inspection rate
- Dispatch acknowledgement time
- Conversion: calls → booked → completed
- Lost reasons (price, out-of-area, no answer, competitor, etc.)

---

## 9) Multi-location routing (if you have multiple branches)

If you operate multiple service areas:

- the system routes by **zip/county**
- supports different **on-call schedules** per branch
- allows overflow between branches when one is slammed

---

## 10) Fail-safes (no single point of failure)

- If AI mode fails → fallback to keypad intake + voicemail rescue
- If nobody responds → escalation ladder
- If call drops → auto-SMS “reply with address & issue” (optional)
